1) This Project done by using IntelliJ IDE on linux OS.
2) To run this project it needed JaCKSON library.
3) Library is included in the lib folder.
4) First import the JaCKSON library.
5) Then put the JSON reprasantation of the graph in the data folder
   (example JSON reprasantations are already in the folder)
   and make sure JSON file path and Main.java line 24 path is same.
6) execute the Main.java file   
7) Code will generate as Program.java in the output folder
8) execute the run.sh.
7) shell script(run.sh) is used to compile, make Program.jar file and execute the Program.jar file.

/**important**/
All the nodes represanted in JSON should have following structure

# exmple split node reprasantation

                {"type":"split",
                "name" : "split_1",
                "func":[" ", "arg.0"],
                "con_true":["while_1"],
                "con_false":[],
                "system" : "true"}

# con_true -> next connected nodes
# con_false -> except for and if nodes this is empty
